# ⚽ Math Soccer

A fast-paced math duel wrapped in a soccer game. Two players race to solve the same problem — answer fastest to take the ball. Score 5 in a row to hit the net. Wrong answer? Turnover. One interception resets everything. Play vs bot or a friend. First to 3 goals wins. Simple math, pure pressure.

## How to Play

- Both players see the same math problem
- **Fastest correct answer** wins possession of the ball
- **5 consecutive correct answers** = GOAL ⚽
- **Wrong answer** = turnover (opponent gets the ball)
- **Opponent answers faster** = interception (streak resets)
- First to **3 goals** wins the match

## Game Modes

- **VS Bot** — Three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- **VS Human** — Local multiplayer, same device
